most of the time when picking a movie with friends,
it starts with “I’m down for anything,”
and ends with 40 minutes of trailer hopping… and no movie watched.

sure, we all have watchlists in JHS, but they’re usually just for ourselves.

so an idea where, what if we could pair up our watchlists to different profiles in JHS, mix up together,
and play a little swipe game to actually agree to disagree and just watch something?

you swipe right on mixed watchlist.
your friend swipes theirs.
when you both swipe right on the same movie, it’s a match.

sharing a mvp of the idea.
and i’m using a free movie database API to fetch the titles,
so apologies to the loading times because of the free tier server.
